## EDuke32 -> NBlood git merging instructions, based on Hendricks266's notes ##

# One-time setup (from the NBlood repository)
git remote add eduke32 https://voidpoint.io/terminx/eduke32.git

# Preparation for merger (in the EDuke32 repository)
1. Update the branch tmp/nblood-engine from the remote EDuke32 repository,
and then checkout it.
2. Ensure it is up to date with NBlood changes by deleting all contents of
source/ from the local filesystem and replacing them with NBlood's contents,
sans directories not existing in the EDuke32 repository, like blood or hmpplay.
If git gui shows unstaged changes, make new commits or
squash updates into existing commits.
3. Rebase the branch over master. Resolve any conflicts so that
the separated commits remain meaningful. Force-push the branch.

# Attempt to merge (into the NBlood repository)
git fetch eduke32
git merge eduke32/master

# Only if there are conflicts, fix them, stage the changes and then
git merge --continue

# Then push
git push origin master
